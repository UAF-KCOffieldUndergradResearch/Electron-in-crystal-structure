Solve the Schrodinger equation numerically for an electron in a uniform crystal.

Initially, we will solve the time-independent Schrodinger H(phi)=E(phi) for the motion of an electron in a lattice of atoms,
or a crystal. The eigenvalues, or the allowed energies, will be solved using Matlab code (at least initially). The first case
will be one-dimensional. The second will be two-dimensional, and finally, we will solve for the three-dimensional case. To
verify theory, we are hoping to see allowed energy bands for given physical and numerical parameters. Inevitably, we would 
like to see how these bands are affected by the introduction of impurities in the crystal.
